                <h2>The Interactive Map</h2>
                <p>After exploring a few options, I quickly settled on using Leaflet as the plugin to handle the map. The proof of concept worked great for the ~2,600 fences. I quickly had my geofences drawn on the map in no time.</p>
                <p>I then tried drawing all ~2.6 million impressions, but there were a few problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even after being minified, the .js file was still clocking in at 50 mb.</li>
                    <li>Predictably, Chrome kept crashing on my localhost trying to run the massive for loop.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some quick research brought the Leaflet MarkerCluster plugin to my attention. It offered a viable solution to draw that number of markers, but I’d still need to find a way to lower the overall number.</p>
                <p>At this point, I decided that I was going to have to aggressively merge markers that were close together. The calculation would be fine, since I would be running that on a separate algorithm. While the loss in resolution was not ideal, it was better than no map.</p>
                <p>Here’s what I tried:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I went for the low hanging fruit and see if I could get away with just keeping the unique coordinates. ~450,000 impressions. Good, but still crashing.</li>
                    <li>I tried rounding to the nearest thousandth (3rd decimal point), just to see where I was in the ballpark. ~150,000 impressions. Getting closer, but it was taking forever to draw. At least, no more crashes.</li>
                    <li>Next was the nearest hundredth (2nd decimal point). ~15,000 impressions. It would work, but it felt like I was sacrificing too much. I could get away with more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From those numbers, I knew I had to get the list to around ~100,000 impressions/markers to get the map to draw with a reasonable loss in resolution. I decided to use a histogram count algorithm to cluster the markers together.</p>
                <p>The algorithm would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>draw a rectangular grid from the minimum to the maximum longitude and latitudes (essentially all of Florida)</li>
                    <li>count the number of impressions in each bin</li>
                    <li>the map would then create markers for the bins with 1 or more impressions, including the number of impressions in the popup</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After some trial and error, I found that the optimal grid dimensions included 3,000 bins in the X direction and 4,000 bins in the Y direction, resulting in 90,000 markers that could be drawn on the map in a reasonable amount of time on localhost and on production (GitHub Pages).</p>
                <p>That result is what you see above.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                <h2>The Number Crunching</h2>
                <p>To calculate the percentage of impressions outside all geofences, I designed my algorithm to take a key advantage of Matlab:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Matlab is really efficient at running an operation across an entire matrix, even for really complex operations, so long as the same operation is being done on every element of the matrix.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is huge because having ~2,600 geofences and ~2.6 million impressions, I really did not want to brute force my for loop and have my desktop run overnight.</p>
                <p>Here’s the algorithm:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>for each geofence,
                        <ol>
                            <li>determine the dimensions of the edges of the box that would fit the geofence (based on the coordinates and the radius) using a reversed Haversine formula</li>
                            <li>update the matrix with the latitude and longitude edges all in one loop for optimization benefits</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>in a second loop, for each geofence:
                        <ol>
                            <li>using the latitude and longitude edges, create a boolean array by testing if each impression is within these edges using Matlab’s ability to run a logical operation across the entire impression matrix at a run speed significantly faster than a for loop</li>
                            <li>for each impression that is within the edges, use the Haversine formula to confirm if the coordinate is within the geofence (as opposed as the corners where the coordinate might be in the square box, but outside the circle)</li>
                            <li>increment a counter for the geofence and the impression if the coordinate is confirmed to be inside</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The result of the algorithm is what you see in the charts above.</p>
