# Project: Atlas
Welcome to the source code for [Project: Atlas](https://andychu.me/atlas). This website and repo exists as a tech demo because I want to:

- showcase my Matlab skills
- get some practice in using Mapbox and the Leaflet js plugin
- get some more practice using Highcharts to beautifully show data
- keep a promise

## Who Is This For?
This repo is mostly for me, but if you like what you see, you can also use this code to:

- implement Leaflet and Highcharts in your own projects
